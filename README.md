# Laboratory 2 on Soft Skills

Welcome to this test repository for laboratory work on soft skills. This repository contains a set of code files that demonstrate how to perform some basic tasks in Python. In this README, we will provide a brief description of the files in the repository and how to use them.

## Files in the Repository

The following files are included in this repository:

- `input_file.csv`: a sample input file for performing some basic statistics calculations
- `output_file.csv`: the output file generated by the statistics code
- `random_number.py`: a script that generates a random number between 1 and 10
- `password_generator.py`: a script that generates a random password and saves it to a file called `password.txt`
- `password_generator_function.py`: a script that defines a function to generate a random password with specified length and complexity

## How to Use the Files

To use the files in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
3. For the statistics code, run the following command: `python statistics.py`. This will read the `input_file.csv` file, perform some basic statistics calculations, and save the results to the `output_file.csv` file.
4. For the random number script, run the following command: `python random_number.py`. This will generate a random number between 1 and 10 and print it to the console.
5. For the password generator script, run the following command: `python password_generator.py`. This will generate a random password and save it to a file called `password.txt`.
6. For the password generator function, you can import the `generate_password` function from `password_generator_function.py` and use it in your own scripts.

## Additional Information

In addition to the files in this repository, we highly recommend adding a README to your own projects. A good README can help other developers understand what your project does, how to use it, and how to contribute to it. Here are some tips for writing a good README:

- Include a brief description of the project and its purpose.
- Provide clear instructions on how to use the project.
- List any dependencies or requirements needed to use the project.
- Explain how to contribute to the project and provide guidelines for contributions.
- Use clear and concise language, and include examples where possible.
- Consider using a table of contents to make the README easier to navigate.

We hope this test repository and README have been helpful in demonstrating some basic Python tasks and the importance of good documentation. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to us.
